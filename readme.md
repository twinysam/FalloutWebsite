# Original Fallout Website

These original ancient HTML pages would break somewhat when viewed on displays wider than 1024 pixels. Everyone (wayback machine, duckandcover.cx, etc) are hosting the pages as they were and thus they all look bad. I've implemented some fixes to keep all pages within that width limit regardless of the display.

There are some things that still look a bit off. Need to figure out that <table> mojo and fix those inconsistencies across pages.
